# 🥯 Bagzel: A Bazel-Powered Rosbag Extraction Pipeline

**Bagzel** is an efficient and reproducible data extraction pipeline for ROS 1 and ROS 2 bag files, built on **Bazel**. It generates structured datasets from recorded robotic data—including image sequences, GPS logs, metadata, and map visualizations—and supports exporting data in the standardized nuScenes format.

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your system:

- **Bazel** ([installation guide](https://bazel.build/install))
- **git**
- **Git Large File Storage (LFS)** ([Git LFS installation guide](https://git-lfs.com))

To install Git LFS:
```bash
git lfs install
```

### 📥 Repository Setup

To obtain and prepare the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UniBwTAS/bagzel.git
cd bagzel
git lfs pull
```
>⚠️ Ensure you run `git lfs pull` to fetch large files such as bag files tracked via Git LFS.



## 🛠️ Build and Run: Minimal Working Example

This section shows the two main functionalities of Bagzel:
1. Building a **nuScenes dataset** from ROS 1 and ROS 2 bag files.
2. Building a **vision dataset** (with evaluation metrics) from ROS 1 bag files.


## Quick builds (fast / minimal)

These are the simplest “sanity check” builds that avoid the heavier cross-bag steps.

### 1) Fastest: build only NuScenes exports (ROS1 + ROS2)

```bash
bazel build @example_data//:data_pipeline_processed__nuscenes_data
```

### 2) ROS1-only visual pipeline outputs (still relatively quick)

```bash
bazel build @example_data//:data_pipeline_processed__visual_data
```


### 3) Per-bag quick build (one bag)

If you want to build just one bag’s outputs, build its per-bag `__everything` filegroup:

```bash
bazel build @example_data//:<stem>__everything
```

You can copy `<stem>` from `bazel query @example_data//:all`.

---

## Full build (everything)

This builds:

- NuScenes exports
- ROS1 processed outputs
- maps (`__maps`)
- merged annotations (`__wm_annos`, `__wm_annos_single_file`)

```bash
bazel build @example_data//:data_pipeline_processed__everything
```
> **Note:** This target builds all outputs and duplicates some generated data, which can significantly increase storage usage. It’s intended for development/testing and is not recommended for production workflows.

### 1. Build own dataset from ROS 1 and ROS 2 bags

The example data is exposed to Bazel via an **external repository**. Bazel then manages all symlinks internally, so you do **not** need to create any symlinks inside the project directory.

You can configure where your bag data is located via the `path` attribute in `MODULE.bazel`. Relative paths are interpreted w.r.t. the workspace root; absolute paths are also supported. For the minimal working example you can leave the default value as is.

Add the following to your `MODULE.bazel`:

```bzl
external_repository = use_extension(
    "@bagzel//src:starlark/rules/core/external_repository.bzl",
    "external_repository",
)

external_repository.local_repo(
    repo_name = "example_data",  # name of the external repository
    build_file = "@bagzel//src/starlark/macros/graph-build:BUILD.graph.bazel",
    empty_build_file = "@bagzel//src/starlark/macros/graph-build:BUILD.graph.empty.bazel",
    path = "data/own_example_data/",  # path to the data directory
)

use_repo(external_repository, "own_example_data")
```

### Adding your own config files

The config directory needs the following structure

```
.
├── BUILD.bazel
├── MODULE.bazel
└── config.bzl
```

Thereby the BUILD.bazel file can be completely empty. The MODULE.bazel file needs one line of code

```
module(name = "bagzel_config", version = "0.0.0")
```

In the config.bzl needs to have the following structure:
